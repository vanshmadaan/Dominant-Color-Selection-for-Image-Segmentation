# Dominant-Color-Selection-for-Image-Segmentation

In this project, we will partition an image into regions having similar appearance corresponding to parts of objects.
<br>
We will try to extract the most dominant 'K' Colors using K-Means.
<br>
We can apply K-Means with each pixel will reassigned to the closest of the K Colors, leading to segmentation
